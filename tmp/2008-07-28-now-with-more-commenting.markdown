I recently decided to add commenting to the blog again because I love my dear
readers so, so much. This would be simple&hellip; except that my blog doesn't have a
database to store them.

[Tim Pease](http://www.pea53.com) (the creator of
[Webby](http://webby.rubyforge.org/)) pointed me to
[Disqus](http://disqus.com/), a javascript-based comment system. It turns out
that setting up Disqus-powered comments was a very simple and painless process
that took three steps and about ten minutes. Here's how it went down:

* [Sign up](http://disqus.com/login/?next=/start/) for a Disqus account and add your blog. Thankfully, they ask for a minimum of information up front.
* Set up your blog integration. There are prebaked instructions for a number of popular blogging platforms. In my case I used the custom integration javascript snippet.
* Modify the CSS to remove unwanted elements (in my case everything but the author, timestamp and text) and style the remaining elements more appropriately for your site.
