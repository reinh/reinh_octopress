In our [first installment](/2008/02/25/to-design-a-blog-1.html),
the typography and layout of the blog were mostly decided. With this ground
work in place, it's time to start focusing on the details.

But first, it's time to give our eyes and brain a chance to relax and reset.
Staring at the same design for hours tends to give you tunnel-vision and we
want to be able to look at the site afresh.

Now that we're ready to continue, the most obvious issue is the arrangement of
the sections in the footer. The rest of the design follows a strict grid system
but the haphazard placement of the bottom columns is jarring to the eye and the
whitespace between them is also problematic.

A third column is added and the columns are properly aligned with the grid
layout once again. Great success! The remaining changes are all relatively
minor and mainly involve tweaks to font size, color, and spacing. Bonus points
if you can spot them.

Now then: Welcome to the new blog! Enjoy your stay.
